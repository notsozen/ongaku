[Verse]

<span>Am</span>       <span>Am maj7</span>       <span>Am7</span>          <span>Am6</span>
My funny valentine, sweet, comic valentine -

<span>F</span>           <span>Dm7</span>     <span>Dm6</span>     <span>E7</span>     <span>Dm</span>     <span>E7</span>
You make me smile with my heart.

<span>Am</span>              <span>E7</span>        <span>Am7</span>    <span>Am6</span>
Your looks are laughable, unphotographable,

<span>F</span>             <span>Dm7</span>      <span>Fm</span>       <span>G7</span>
Yet you're my favorite work of art.


[Bridge]

        <span>C</span>      <span>G7</span>        <span>C</span>
Is your figure less than Greek?

<span>Dm7</span> <span>G7</span>   <span>C</span>      <span>Dm7</span>     <span>C</span>
Is your mouth a little weak?

<span>Dm7</span>   <span>G7</span>  <span>CM7</span>  <span>E7+</span>    <span>E7</span>     <span>Am</span>        <span>FM7</span>     <span>F7</span>
When you open  it  to speak, are you smart?

<span>E7</span>  <span>Am</span>             <span>Ammaj7</span>
But don't change a hair for me,

<span>Am7</span>        <span>Am6</span>
Not if you care for me -

 <span>F</span>          <span>Bm7-5</span>       <span>E7</span>     <span>Am</span>     <span>C7</span>
Stay, little val - en - tine, stay!

 <span>F</span>   <span>FM7</span>    <span>Dm7</span>         <span>G7</span>    <span>C</span>     <span>F7</span>    <span>E7</span>
Each day is val - en - tine's day.


[Bridge]

<span>E7</span>   <span>Am</span>            <span>Ammaj7</span>
But don't change a hair for me,

<span>Am7</span>        <span>Am6</span>
Not if you care for me -

 <span>F</span>          <span>Bm7-5</span>       <span>E7</span>     <span>Am</span>    <span>C7</span>
Stay, little val - en - tine, stay!

 <span>F</span>   <span>FM7</span>    <span>Dm7</span>         <span>G7</span>     <span>C</span>    <span>Fdim</span>    <span>CM7</span>
Each day is val - en - tine's day.</pre>
