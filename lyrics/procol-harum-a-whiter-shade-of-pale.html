<span>G</span>  <span>Bm/F#</span>  <span>Em</span>  <span>G/D</span>   <span>C</span>  <span>C/B</span>  <span>Am</span>  <span>Am/G</span>   <span>D</span>  <span>D/C</span>   <span>Bm</span>  <span>D7/A</span>   <span>G</span>  <span>C</span>  <span>D</span>

Verse 1 (same for Verse 2, verse 2 lyrics at bottom)

<span>G</span>    <span>Bm/F#</span>             <span>Em</span>     <span>G/D</span>
We skipped the light fandango
<span>C</span>    <span>C/B</span>                     <span>Am</span>    <span>Am/G</span>
turned cartwheels 'cross the floor
<span>D</span>       <span>D/C</span>          <span>Bm</span>     <span>Am</span>  <span>D7/A</span>
I was feeling kinda seasick
<span>G</span>        <span>Bm/F#</span>          <span>Em</span>         <span>G/D</span>
but the crowd called out for more
<span>C</span>       <span>C/B</span>          <span>Am</span>     <span>Am/G</span>
The room was humming harder
<span>D</span>       <span>D/C</span>          <span>Bm</span>    <span>Am</span>  <span>D7/A</span>
as the ceiling flew away
<span>G</span>          <span>Bm/F#</span>           <span>Em</span>     <span>G/D</span>
When we called out for another drink
<span>C</span>       <span>C/B</span>          <span>Am</span>
the waiter brought a tray

Chorus

<span>D</span>          <span>G</span>  <span>Bm/F#</span>       <span>Em</span>    <span>G7/D</span>
And so it was,___ that later,____
<span>C</span>       <span>C/B</span>             <span>Am</span>  <span>Am/G</span>
as the miller told his tale
<span>D</span>   <span>D/C</span>                  <span>Bm</span>           <span>D7/A</span>
that her face, at first just ghostly,
           <span>G</span>    <span>C</span>        <span>G</span>    <span>D7</span>
turned a whiter shade of pale


Instrumental - Same as Intro

<span>G</span>  <span>Bm/F#</span>  <span>Em</span>  <span>G/D</span>   <span>C</span>  <span>C/B</span>  <span>Am</span>  <span>Am/G</span>   <span>D</span>  <span>D/C</span>   <span>Bm</span>  <span>D7/A</span>   <span>G</span>  <span>C</span>  <span>D</span>



Verse 2

<span>G</span>    <span>Bm/F#</span>             <span>Em</span>     <span>G/D</span>
She said, 'There is no reason
<span>C</span>    <span>C/B</span>                     <span>Am</span>    <span>Am/G</span>
and the truth is plain to see.'
<span>D</span>       <span>D/C</span>          <span>Bm</span>      <span>D7/A</span>
But I wandered through my playing cards
<span>G</span>        <span>Bm/F#</span>          <span>Em</span>         <span>G/D</span>
and would not let her be
<span>C</span>       <span>C/B</span>          <span>Am</span>     <span>Am/G</span>
one of sixteen vestal virgins
<span>D</span>       <span>D/C</span>          <span>Bm</span>    <span>Am</span>  <span>D7/A</span>
who were leaving for the coast
<span>G</span>          <span>Bm/F#</span>           <span>Em</span>     <span>G/D</span>
and although my eyes were open
<span>C</span>       <span>C/B</span>          <span>Am</span>
they might have just as well've been closed


Chorus

<span>D</span>          <span>G</span>  <span>Bm/F#</span>       <span>Em</span>    <span>G/D</span>
And so it was,___ that later,____
<span>C</span>       <span>C/B</span>             <span>Am</span>  <span>Am/G</span>
as the miller told his tale
<span>D</span>   <span>D/C</span>                  <span>Bm</span>           <span>Am</span>  <span>D7/A</span>
that her face, at first just ghostly,
           <span>G</span>    <span>C</span>        <span>G</span>    <span>D7</span>
turned a whiter shade of pale

Chorus

<span>D</span>          <span>G</span>  <span>Bm/F#</span>       <span>Em</span>    <span>G/D</span>

that her face, at first just ghostly,
           <span>G</span>    <span>C</span>        <span>G</span>    <span>D7</span>
turned a whiter shade of pale
