Verse
<span>F</span>         <span>Am</span>
Somewhere over the rainbow
<span>Bb</span>         <span>F</span>
   Way up high
<span>Bb</span>       <span>F</span>
And the dreams that you dream of
<span>C</span>          <span>Dm</span>      <span>Bb</span>
Once in a lullaby...

     <span>F</span>        <span>Am</span>
Oh, somewhere over the rainbow
<span>Bb</span>             <span>F</span>
   Blue birds fly
<span>Bb</span>        <span>F</span>
And the dreams that you dream of
<span>C</span>                     <span>Dm</span>    <span>Bb</span>
Dreams really do come true...

     <span>F</span>
Someday I'll wish upon a star
<span>C</span>                                  <span>Dm</span>   <span>Bb</span>
Wake up where the clouds are far behind me
      <span>F</span>
Where trouble melts like lemon drops
<span>C</span>
High above the chimney tops
       <span>Dm</span>           <span>Bb</span>
That's where you'll find me
    <span>F</span>         <span>Am</span>
Oh, somewhere over the rainbow
<span>Bb</span>             <span>F</span>
   Blue birds fly
<span>Bb</span>       <span>F</span>
And the dream that you dare to
<span>C</span>               <span>Dm</span>   <span>Bb</span>
Why oh why can't I...

     <span>F</span>
Someday I'll wish upon a star
<span>C</span>                                  <span>Dm</span>   <span>Bb</span>
Wake up where the clouds are far behind me
      <span>F</span>
Where trouble melts like lemon drops
<span>C</span>
High above the chimney tops
       <span>Dm</span>           <span>Bb</span>
That's where you'll find me
    <span>F</span>         <span>Am</span>
Oh, somewhere over the rainbow
<span>Bb</span>          <span>F</span>
   Way up high
<span>Bb</span>       <span>F</span>
And the dreams that you dare to
<span>Bb</span>      <span>C</span>         <span>Dm</span>   <span>Bb</span>
Why oh why can't I
