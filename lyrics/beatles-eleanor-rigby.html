[Intro]

<span>Bb</span>                             <span>Dm</span>
Ah, look at all the lonely people
<span>Bb</span>                             <span>Dm</span>
Ah, look at all the lonely people


[Verse]

<span>Dm</span>                                                                <span>Bb</span>
Eleanor rigby picks up the rice in the church where a wedding has been

Lives in a dream
<span>Dm</span>                                                                   <span>Bb</span>
Waits at the window, wearing the face that she keeps in a jar by the door
           <span>Dm</span>
Who is it for?


[Chorus]

<span>Dm7</span>            <span>Dm6</span>
All the lonely people
<span>Bb</span>                               <span>Dm</span>
Where do they all come from ?
<span>Dm7</span>            <span>Dm6</span>
All the lonely people
<span>Bb</span>                         <span>Dm</span>
Where do they all belong ?


[Verse 2]

<span>Dm</span>                                                             <span>Bb</span>
Father mckenzie writing the words of a sermon that no one will hear

No one comes near.
<span>Dm</span>                                                                      <span>Bb</span>
Look at him working. darning his socks in the night when there's nobody there
                    <span>Dm</span>
What does he care?


[Chorus]

<span>Dm7</span>            <span>Dm6</span>
All the lonely people
<span>Bb</span>                               <span>Dm</span>
Where do they all come from?
<span>Dm7</span>            <span>Dm6</span>
All the lonely people
<span>Bb</span>                       <span>Dm</span>
Where do they all belong?

<span>Bb</span>                            <span>Dm</span>
Ah, Look at all the lonely People
<span>Bb</span>                            <span>Dm</span>
Ah Look at All the lonely people

Eleanor rigby died in the church and was buried along with her name

Nobody came
<span>Dm</span>                                                                  <span>Bb</span>
Father mckenzie wiping the dirt from his hands as he walks from the grave
              <span>Dm</span>
No one was saved


[Chorus]

<span>Dm7</span>          <span>Dm6</span>
All the lonely people
<span>Bb</span>                          <span>Dm</span>
Where do they all come from?

All the lonely people
