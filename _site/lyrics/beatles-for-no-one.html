[Verse]

<span>C</span>                <span>C/B</span>
 Your day breaks, your mind aches
<span>Am</span>             <span>C/G</span>              <span>F</span>               <span>Bb</span>
 You find that all the words of kindness linger on
            <span>C</span>
When she no longer needs you


[Verse]

<span>C</span>             <span>C/B</span>
 She wakes up, she makes up
<span>Am</span>             <span>C/G</span>              <span>F</span>               <span>Bb</span>
 She takes her time and doesn't feel she has to hurry
       <span>C</span>
She no longer needs you


[Chorus]

           <span>Dm</span>           <span>A7</span>
And in her eyes you see nothing
<span>Dm</span>               [ <span>A7</span> ]     <span>Dm</span>
 No sign of love behind the tears
          <span>A7</span>
Cried for no one
<span>Dm</span>                      [ <span>A7</span> ]  <span>Dm</span>       <span>Gsus4</span> <span>G</span>
 A love that should have lasted years


[Verse]

<span>C</span>             <span>C/B</span>
 You want her, you need her
<span>Am</span>           <span>C/G</span>               <span>F</span>                 <span>Bb</span>
 And yet you don't believe her when she says her love is dead
    <span>C</span>
You think she needs you


[Solo]

| <span>C</span> <span>C/B</span> | <span>Am</span> <span>C/G</span> | <span>F</span> <span>Bb</span> | <span>C</span> | % |


[Chorus]

           <span>Dm</span>           <span>A7</span>
And in her eyes you see nothing
<span>Dm</span>               [ <span>A7</span> ]     <span>Dm</span>
 No sign of love behind the tears
          <span>A7</span>
Cried for no one
<span>Dm</span>                      [ <span>A7</span> ]  <span>Dm</span>       <span>Gsus4</span> <span>G</span>
 A love that should have lasted years


[Verse]

<span>C</span>              <span>C/B</span>
 You stay home, she goes out
<span>Am</span>             <span>C/G</span>          <span>F</span>                <span>Bb</span>
 She says that long ago she knew someone but now he's gone
    <span>C</span>
She doesn't need him


[Verse]

<span>C</span>                <span>C/B</span>
 Your day breaks, your mind aches
<span>Am</span>             <span>C/G</span>                <span>F</span>                    <span>Bb</span>
 There will be times when all the things she said will fill your head
<span>C</span>
You won't forget her


[Chorus]

           <span>Dm</span>           <span>A7</span>
And in her eyes you see nothing
<span>Dm</span>               [ <span>A7</span> ]     <span>Dm</span>
 No sign of love behind the tears
          <span>A7</span>
Cried for no one
<span>Dm</span>                      [ <span>A7</span> ]  <span>Dm</span>       <span>Gsus4</span> <span>G</span>
 A love that should have lasted years </pre>
