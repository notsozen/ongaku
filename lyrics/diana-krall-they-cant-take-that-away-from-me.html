     <span>Em7</span>     <span>A7/9</span>      <span>D6</span>  <span>F#m</span>  <span>D6</span>
The way you wear your hat
     <span>D</span>     <span>Fdim</span>      <span>A7</span>   <span>A4/7</span> <span>A7</span>
The way you sip your tea
    <span>Em7</span>    <span>A7/9</span>    <span>D7+</span>   <span>Am7</span> <span>D7</span>
The mem'ry  of all that
   <span>Cdim</span>       <span>G</span>          <span>Em</span>   <span>Bm5-/7</span>     <span>A7</span>
No, no, they can't take that away from me
    <span>Em7</span>       <span>A7/9</span>       <span>D6</span>    <span>F#m</span>  <span>D6</span>
The way your smile just beams
     D     <span>Fdim</span>      <span>A7</span>   <span>A4/7</span> <span>A7</span>
The way you sing off key
    <span>Em7</span>    <span>A7/9</span>       <span>D7+</span>   <span>Am7</span> <span>D7</span>
The way you haunt my dreams
   <span>Cdim</span>       <span>G</span>              <span>Em</span>  <span>A7</span>  <span>D</span>
No, no, they can't take that away from me
<span>D7+</span>     <span>F#m</span>       <span>B7</span>    <span>F#m</span>    <span>B7</span>         <span>F#m</span>      <span>B7</span>      <span>C#7</span>
We may never, never meet again on the bumpy road to love
            <span>F#m</span>     <span>B7</span>     <span>F#m</span>      <span>B7</span>     <span>E7</span>    <span>A7</span>
Still, I'll always, always keep the memory of
    <span>Em7</span>      <span>A7/9</span>        <span>D6</span>    <span>F#m</span>  <span>D6</span>
The way you hold your knife
     <span>D</span>     <span>Fdim</span>         <span>A7</span>   <span>A4/7</span> <span>A7</span>
The way we danced till three
   <span>Em7</span>       <span>A7/9</span>       <span>D7+</span>     <span>Am7</span> <span>D7</span>
The way you changed my life
    <span>Cdim</span>       <span>G</span>         <span>Em</span>       <span>A7</span>       <span>Bm7</span>
No, no, they can't take that away from me
<span>Em7</span>       <span>D</span>    <span>G</span>     <span>D</span>  <span>F#m</span>   <span>G</span>    <span>A</span>  <span>D</span>  <span>D7+</span> <span>Em7</span>
No, they can't take that away from me
