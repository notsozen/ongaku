<pre class="_1YgOS" style="font-size: 15px; font-family: &quot;Roboto Mono&quot;, monospace;">[Intro]
<span>F</span> <span>Am</span> <span>F</span> <span>Am</span> <span>F</span> <span>Am</span> <span>F</span> <span>Am</span> <span>D7sus2</span>

[Verse 1]
<span>F</span>
I am on an open sea
                                     <span>Am</span>
Just drifting as the hours go slowly by
<span>F</span>
Julie with her open blouse
                            <span>Am</span>
Is gazing up into the empty sky

[Chorus]
<span>G</span>                     <span>Em</span>      <span>F</span>
Now it seems to be so strange here
<span>G</span>            <span>Em</span>
Now it's so blue
    <span>F</span>            <span>C</span>             <span>D7sus2</span>
The still sea is darker than before

[instrumental guitar]
<span>D7sus2</span> <span>F</span> <span>Am</span>

[Instrumental synth]
<span>D</span> <span>G</span> <span>D</span> <span>G</span> <span>D</span> <span>G</span> <span>D</span> <span>Dm</span> <span>D</span> <span>F</span> <span>Am</span>

[Verse 2]
<span>F</span>
No wind disturbs our colored sail
                            <span>Am</span>
The radio is silent, so are we
<span>F</span>
Julie's head is on her arm
                                     <span>Am</span>
Her fingers brush the surface of the sea

[Chorus]
<span>G</span>                        <span>Em</span>    <span>F</span>
Now I wonder if we'll be seen, here
<span>G</span>                          <span>Em</span>
Or if time has left us all alone
    <span>F</span>            <span>C</span>             <span>D7sus2</span>
The still sea is darker than before

[Instrumental
<span>F</span> <span>Am</span> <span>F</span> <span>Am</span> <span>F</span> <span>Am</span> <span>F</span> <span>Am</span> <span>F</span> <span>Am</span></pre>
