<pre>[Verse]

<span>A</span>    <span>F#m</span>    <span>C#m</span>             <span>D</span>        <span>A</span>
somewhere over the rainbow, way up high
  <span>D</span>    <span>Dm</span>    <span>A</span>       <span>F#m</span>      <span>Bm</span>         <span>E</span>     <span>A</span>
theres a land that i heard of once in a lullaby

<span>A</span>    <span>F#m</span>    <span>C#m</span>             <span>D</span>          <span>A</span>
somewhere over the rainbow skies are blue
<span>D</span>   <span>Dm</span>      <span>A</span>            <span>F#m</span>     <span>Bm</span>         <span>E</span>         <span>A</span>
and the dreams that you dare to dream really do come true


[Middle]

<span>A</span>
someday ill wish upon a star
    <span>Bm</span>                                 <span>F#m</span>      <span>Bm</span>   <span>E</span>
and wake up where the clouds are far behind me
       <span>A</span>
where troubles melt like lemon drops
  <span>G#m</span>
away above the chimney tops
       <span>C#m</span>          <span>Bm</span>   <span>E</span>
thats where you'll find me


[Verse]

<span>A</span>     <span>F#m</span> <span>C#m</span>               <span>D</span>          <span>A</span>
somewhere over the rainbow skies are blue
<span>D</span>   <span>Dm</span>      <span>A</span>            <span>F#m</span>     <span>Bm</span>         <span>E</span>         <span>A</span>
and the dreams that you dare to dream really do come true


[Middle]

<span>A</span>
someday ill wish upon a star
    <span>Bm</span>                                 <span>F#m</span>      <span>Bm</span>   <span>E</span>
and wake up where the clouds are far behind me
       <span>A</span>
where troubles melt like lemon drops
 <span>G#m</span>
away above the chimney tops
       <span>C#m</span>          <span>Bm</span>   <span>E</span>

[Verse]

<span>A</span>     <span>F#m</span>  <span>C#m</span>               <span>D</span>        <span>A</span>
Somewhere over the rainbow, Bluebirds fly
  <span>D</span>    <span>Dm</span>    <span>A</span>       <span>F#m</span>      <span>Bm</span>         <span>E</span>     <span>A</span>
Birds fly over the rainbow. Why, then oh why can't I?


[outro]

    <span>A</span>                             <span>Bm</span>
if happy little bluebirds fly beyond the rainbow
  <span>E</span>           <span>A</span>
why oh why can't i?</pre>
