<pre>[Intro] <span>G</span> <span>Em</span> <span>Bm</span> <span>G</span> <span>Em</span> <span>Bm</span> <span>D</span> <span>C</span> <span>D</span> <span>G</span> <span>C</span> <span>D</span> <span>G</span>


[Verse 1]

<span>G</span>           <span>Em</span>             <span>Bm</span>
This is for all the lonely people
<span>G</span>             <span>Em</span>                   <span>Bm</span>  <span>D</span>
Thinking that life has passed them by
<span>C</span>          <span>D</span>            <span>G</span>
Don't give up until you drink from the silver cup
    <span>C</span>         <span>D</span>              <span>G</span>       <span>D</span>
And ride that highway in the sky


[Verse 2]

<span>G</span>           <span>Em</span>             <span>Bm</span>
This is for all the single people
<span>G</span>             <span>Em</span>                 <span>Bm</span>  <span>D</span>
Thinking that love has left them dry
<span>C</span>          <span>D</span>            <span>G</span>
Don't give up until you drink from the silver cup
    <span>C</span>     <span>D</span>              <span>G</span>
You never know until you try


[Chorus]

          <span>C</span> <span>G/B</span> <span>Am</span>
Well, I'm on my way
          <span>C</span> <span>G/B</span> <span>Am</span>
Yes, I'm back to stay
          <span>C</span> <span>G/B</span> <span>Am</span>  <span>D</span>    <span>G</span>      <span>D</span>
Well, I'm on my way back home


[Instrumental] <span>G</span> <span>Em</span> <span>Bm</span> <span>G</span> <span>Em</span> <span>Bm</span> <span>D</span> <span>C</span> <span>D</span> <span>G</span> <span>C</span> <span>D</span> <span>G</span>


[Verse 3]

<span>G</span>           <span>Em</span>             <span>Bm</span>
This is for all the lonely people
<span>G</span>             <span>Em</span>                   <span>Bm</span>  <span>D</span>
Thinking that life has passed them by
<span>C</span>          <span>D</span>            <span>G</span>
Don't give up until you drink from the silver cup
<span>C</span>            <span>D</span>                <span>G</span>
She'll never take you down or never give you up
<span>C</span>            <span>D</span>              <span>Em</span>.
You'll never know until you try.</pre>
