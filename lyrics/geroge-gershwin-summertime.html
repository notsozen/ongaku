<pre>Summertime

<span>B7</span>     <span>Em</span>    <span>B7</span> <span>Em</span>              <span>Am7</span>         <span>Em</span>     <span>Am</span>  <span>Em</span>
Summer-time,          and the   livin' is   easy;

<span>Em</span>         <span>Am</span>      <span>Am7+</span>  <span>Am7</span>          <span>C</span>         <span>B7</span>     <span>C</span>   <span>B7</span>
Fish are  jumpin',           and the  cotton is high.


<span>B7</span>            <span>Em</span>    <span>B7</span> <span>Em</span>          <span>Am7</span>         <span>Em</span>       <span>Am</span>  <span>Em</span>  <span>Am</span>
Your daddy's  rich        and your mama's good-lookin',

<span>Am</span>   <span>G</span>              <span>Am</span>     <span>CM7</span>    <span>B7</span>    <span>Em</span>    <span>Am</span>   <span>Em</span>  <span>B7</span>
So   hush, little   baby,  don't  you   cry.


<span>B7</span>            <span>Em</span>         <span>B7</span> <span>Em</span>               <span>Am7</span>      <span>Em</span>       <span>Am</span>  <span>Em</span>
One of these  mornin's,        you're gonna  rise up  singin';

<span>Em</span>           <span>Am</span>                <span>Am</span>+7 <span>Am7</span>    <span>C</span>            <span>B7</span>    <span>C</span>  <span>B7</span>
You're gonna spread your wings         And take to the  sky.



<span>B7</span>            <span>Em</span>       <span>B7</span> <span>Em</span>         <span>Am7</span>                <span>Em</span>    <span>Am</span>  <span>Em</span>  <span>Am</span>
But 'til that mornin',        ain't  nothin' can harm   you

<span>Am</span>    <span>G</span>           <span>Am</span>      <span>CM7</span>     <span>B7</span>     <span>Em</span>    <span>Am</span>   <span>Em</span>  <span>B7</span>  <span>Em</span>
With  daddy and   mammy   stand - in'    by.
</pre>
