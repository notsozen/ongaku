[Intro]|<span>Am</span>   |<span>Am</span>   |<span>Am</span>/<span>E</span> |     |<span>Am</span>/<span>D#</span>|     |<span>Am/D</span> |     |<span>Am</span>/<span>D#</span>|    |
       |<span>Am</span>  <span>G</span>|<span>Am</span>  <span>G</span>|<span>Am</span>  <span>G</span>|<span>Am</span>  <span>G</span>|

    <span>Am</span>            <span>G</span> <span>Am</span>           <span>C</span>    <span>Am</span>              <span>G</span>     <span>Am</span>   <span>C</span>
The Queen of Light  took her bow, and then she turned to go
    <span>Am</span>             <span>G</span>  <span>Am</span>               <span>C</span>    <span>Am</span>               <span>G</span>    <span>Am</span>   <span>C</span>
The Prince of Peace embraced the gloom, and walked the night alone


[Chorus]

<span>D</span>
(Oh, dance in the dark of night, sing to the morning light.)
    <span>Am</span>              <span>G</span>  <span>Am</span>           <span>C</span>    <span>Am</span>             <span>G</span>  <span>Am</span>   <span>C</span>
The Dark Lord rides in force tonight and time will tell us all.


[Verse]

 <span>D</span>
(Oh, throw down your plow and hoe, rest not to lock your homes)
<span>Am</span>          <span>G</span>   <span>Am</span>            <span>C</span>       <span>Am</span>         <span>G</span>        <span>Am</span>    <span>C</span>
Side by side we wait the might of the darkest of them all.

|<span>D</span>   |    |    |    |<span>Am</span>   <span>G</span>|<span>Am</span>   <span>C</span>|<span>Am</span>   <span>G</span>|<span>Am</span>   <span>C</span>|

<span>C</span>          <span>D</span>               <span>C</span>                  <span>D</span>
I hear the horses thunder, down in the valley below
<span>G7</span>                   <span>C</span>                 <span>G7</span>                      <span>C</span>
 I'm waiting for the angels of Avalon, waiting for the eastern glow

    <span>Am</span>        <span>G</span>   <span>Am</span>         <span>C</span>    <span>Am</span>                <span>G</span>    <span>Am</span>    <span>C</span>
The apples of the valley hold the seeds of happiness,
    <span>Am</span>             <span>G</span>    <span>Am</span>         <span>C</span>   <span>Am</span>          <span>G</span>  <span>Am</span>    <span>C</span>
The ground is rich from tender care, repay, do not forget
<span>D</span>
(Oh, dance in the dark of night, sing to the morning light)

    <span>Am</span>         <span>G</span>   <span>Am</span>              <span>C</span>    <span>Am</span>           <span>G</span>   <span>Am</span>    <span>C</span>
The apples turn to brown and black, the tyrant's face is red.
<span>D</span>
(Oh, war is common cry, pick up you swords and fly.)
    <span>Am</span>           <span>G</span>     <span>Am</span>          <span>C</span>     <span>Am</span>         <span>G</span>  <span>Am</span>    <span>C</span>
The sky is filled with good and bad that mortals never know.

|<span>D</span>   |    |    |    |<span>Am</span>   <span>G</span>|<span>Am</span>   <span>C</span>|<span>Am</span>   <span>G</span>|<span>Am</span>   <span>C</span>|
(oh-oh-h)

<span>C</span>               <span>D</span>                 <span>C</span>                  <span>D</span>
  Oh, well, the night is long the beads of time pass slow,
<span>G7</span>                  <span>C</span>        <span>G7</span>                      <span>C</span>
  Tired eyes on the sunrise, waiting for the eastern glow.

    <span>Am</span>         <span>G</span>   <span>Am</span>        <span>C</span>    <span>Am</span>       <span>G</span>  <span>Am</span>    <span>C</span>
The pain of war cannot exceed the woe of aftermath,
    <span>Am</span>              <span>G</span>    <span>Am</span>          <span>C</span>    <span>Am</span>               <span>G</span>  <span>Am</span>     <span>C</span>
The drums will shake the castle wall, the Ringwraiths ride in black,  Ride..
<span>D</span>
  ...On,  (Sing as you raise your bow, shoot straighter than before)

   <span>Am</span>         <span>G</span>    <span>Am</span>           <span>C</span>     <span>Am</span>              <span>G</span>  <span>Am</span>    <span>C</span>
No comfort has the fire at night that lights the face so cold.


[Chorus]

<span>D</span>
(Oh, dance in the dark of night, sing to the morning light.)
    <span>Am</span>         <span>G</span>    <span>Am</span>          <span>C</span>   <span>Am</span>           <span>G</span>    <span>Am</span>   <span>C</span>
The magic runes are writ in gold to bring the balance back,  bring it back

|<span>D</span>   |    |    |    |<span>Am</span>   <span>G</span>|<span>Am</span>   <span>C</span>|<span>Am</span>   <span>G</span>|<span>Am</span>   <span>C</span>|

<span>C</span>           <span>D</span>                   <span>C</span>                   <span>D</span>
At last the sun is shining, the clouds of blue roll by,
<span>G7</span>                     <span>C</span>                      <span>G7</span>                  <span>C</span>
  With flames from the dragon of darkness the sunlight blinds his eyes.

|<span>Am</span>   |    |<span>Am/E</span>|    |<span>Am</span>/<span>D#</span>|    |<span>Am/D</span>|         |<span>Am</span>/<span>D#</span>|    |
|<span>Em</span>   |    |    |    |     |    |    |         |
                                       Bring it

<span>Am</span>    <span>G</span>        <span>Am</span>    <span>C</span>        <span>Am</span>    <span>G</span>        <span>Am</span>    <span>C</span>
Back, bring it back, bring it back, bring it back, bring it
<span>Am</span>    <span>G</span>        <span>Am</span>    <span>C</span>        <span>Am</span>    <span>G</span>        <span>Am</span>      <span>C</span>
Back, bring it back, bring it back, bring it back,
<span>D</span>
  Oh now, oh now, oh now oh, oh now, oh now, oh now oh, bring it
<span>Am</span>    <span>G</span>        <span>Am</span>    <span>C</span>        <span>Am</span>    <span>G</span>        <span>Am</span>      <span>C</span>
Back, bring it back, bring it back, bring it back,
<span>D</span>
  Oh now, oh now, oh now oh, oh now, oh now, oh now oh, bring it

<span>Am</span>              <span>G</span>         <span>Am</span>                  <span>C</span>
Bring it, bring it, bring it, bring it, bring it
<span>Am</span>              <span>G</span>         <span>Am</span>                  <span>C</span>
Bring it, bring it, bring it, bring it, bring it
