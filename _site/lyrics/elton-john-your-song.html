[Intro]
   <span>C</span>          <span>F/C</span>        <span>G/C</span>          <span>F/C</span>


[Verse 1]
<span>C</span>                 <span>Fmaj7</span>  <span>G/B</span>            <span>Em</span>
It's a little bit funny, this feeling inside
<span>Am</span>             <span>Am/G</span>          <span>Am/F#</span>  <span>F</span>
I'm not one of those who can easily hide
<span>C/G</span>          <span>G</span>           <span>E</span>        <span>Am</span>
I don't much money, but, boy if I did
<span>C</span>             <span>Dm</span>          <span>F</span>             <span>G</span>    <span>Gsus4</span> – <span>G</span>
I'd buy a big house where we both could live


[Verse 2]
<span>C</span>          <span>Fmaj7</span>     <span>G/B</span>            <span>Em</span>
If I was a sculptor, but then again no
<span>Am</span>                 <span>Am/G</span>         <span>Am/F#</span>      <span>F</span>
Or a man who makes potions in a travelling show
<span>C/G</span>             <span>G</span>                 <span>E</span>          <span>Am</span>
I know it's not much but it's the best I can do
<span>C</span>             <span>Dm</span>        <span>F</span>             <span>C</span> – <span>Csus4</span> – <span>C</span>
My gift is my song, and this one for you


[Chorus]
<span>G/B</span>              <span>Am</span>        <span>Dm</span>           <span>F</span>
And you can tell everybody this is your song
<span>G/B</span>       <span>Am</span>               <span>Dm</span>            <span>F</span>
It may be quite simple but now that it's done
<span>Am</span>                     <span>Am/G</span>
I hope you don't mind, I hope you don't mind
<span>Am/F#</span>             <span>F6</span>
That I put down in words,
    <span>C/E</span>       <span>F6</span>            <span>F</span>             <span>G</span>   <span>Gsus4</span> – <span>G</span>
How wonderful life is while you're in the world

   <span>C</span>          <span>F/C</span>        <span>G/C</span>          <span>F/C</span>


[Verse 3]
<span>C</span>            <span>Fmaj7</span>  <span>G/B</span>                <span>Em</span>
I sat on the roof,  and kicked off the moss
<span>Am</span>                <span>Am/G</span>           <span>Am/F#</span>        <span>F</span>
Well a few of the verses they've got me quite crossed
<span>C/G</span>                <span>G</span>           <span>E</span>                  <span>Am</span>
But the sun's been quite kind, while I wrote this song
<span>C</span>                    <span>Dm</span>            <span>F</span>           <span>G</span>   <span>Gsus4</span> – <span>G</span>
It's for people like you that they keep turned on


[Verse 4]
<span>C</span>            <span>Fmaj7</span>       <span>G/B</span>         <span>Em</span>
So excuse me forgetting, but these I do
<span>Am</span>              <span>Am/G</span>              <span>Am/F#</span>            <span>F</span>
You see I've forgotten if they're green or they're blue
<span>C/G</span>         <span>G</span>                <span>E</span>       <span>Am</span>
Anyway, the thing is, what I reallly mean
<span>C</span>             <span>Dm</span>            <span>F</span>         <span>C</span> – <span>Csus4</span> – <span>C</span>
Yours are the sweetest eyes I've ever seen


[Chorus]
<span>G/B</span>              <span>Am</span>        <span>Dm</span>           <span>F</span>
And you can tell everybody this is your song
<span>G/B</span>       <span>Am</span>               <span>Dm</span>            <span>F</span>
It may be quite simple but now that it's done
<span>Am</span>                     <span>Am/G</span>
I hope you don't mind, I hope you don't mind
<span>Am/F#</span>             <span>F6</span>
That I put down in words,
    <span>C/E</span>       <span>F6</span>            <span>F</span>             <span>G</span>   <span>Gsus4</span> – <span>G</span>
How wonderful life is while you're in the world


[Outro]
<span>Am</span>                     <span>Am/G</span>
I hope you don't mind, I hope you don't mind
<span>Am/F#</span>             <span>F6</span>
That I put down in words,
    <span>C/E</span>       <span>F6</span>       <span>F</span>             (intro)*
How wonderful life is while you're in the world
