<pre><span>C</span>
Here we are
<span>C</span>
Stuck by this river,
<span>Am</span>
You and I
<span>Am</span>
Underneath a sky that's ever falling
<span>F</span>
down, down, down
               <span>Am</span>
Ever falling down.

<span>C</span>
Through the day
<span>C</span>
As if on an ocean
<span>Am</span>
Waiting here,
<span>Am</span>
Always failing to remember why we
<span>F</span>
  came, came, came:
               <span>Am</span>
I wonder why we came.

<span>C</span>
You talk to me
<span>C</span>
as if from a distance
<span>Am</span>
And I reply
<span>Am</span>
With impressions chosen from another
<span>F</span>
  time, time, time,
                <span>Am</span>
From another time.</pre>
