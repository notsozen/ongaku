[Verse 1]
<span>Gmaj7</span>                   <span>Gm6/A#</span>
       I'm not in love,        ...so don't forget it,
<span>F#m7</span>                <span>F#7</span>             <span>Bm</span>            <span>Bm7/A</span>
       It's just a silly phase I'm going through,
<span>Gmaj7</span>                     <span>Gm6/A#</span>
       And, just because        ...I call you up,
<span>F#m7</span>                 <span>F#7</span>                      <span>Bm</span>           <span>Bm7/A</span>
       Don't get me wrong, don't think you've got it made,
<span>Gmaj7</span>                        <span>A</span> *  <span>A7</span>           <span>D</span>   <span>G/D</span>  <span>Dm7</span> <span>G/D</span>
       I'm not in love, no, no,     it's be - cause------------...


[Verse 2]
<span>Gmaj7</span>                     <span>Gm6/A#</span>
    ...I like to see you,         but then again,
<span>F#m7</span>                <span>F#7</span>                 <span>Bm</span>          <span>Bm7/A</span>
       That doesn't mean you mean that much to me,
<span>Gmaj7</span>                     <span>Gm6/A#</span>
       So if I call you,          don't make a fuss,
<span>F#m7</span>                     <span>F#7</span>             <span>Bm</span>         <span>Bm7/A</span>
       Don't tell your friends about the two of us,
<span>Gmaj7</span>                        <span>A</span> *  <span>A7</span>              <span>D</span>
       I'm not in love, no, no,       it's be - cause----...

Oo-------, you'll wait a long time for me,

[Verse 3]
<span>Gmaj7</span>                       <span>Gm6/A#</span>
       I keep your picture       ...upon the wall,
<span>F#m7</span>               <span>F#7</span>                 <span>Bm</span>           <span>Bm7/A</span>
       It hides a nasty stain that's lying there,
<span>Gmaj7</span>                       <span>Gm6/Bb</span>
       So don't you ask me       ...to give it back,
<span>F#m7</span>                        <span>F#7</span>             <span>Bm</span>          <span>Bm7/A</span>
       I know you know it doesn't mean that much to me,
<span>Gmaj7</span>                    <span>A#dim</span>
       I'm not in love,       ...I'm not in love!
