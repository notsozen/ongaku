[Intro:]  <span>C</span>  <span>F</span>  <span>G7</span>

[Verse 1]
<span>C</span>                      <span>F</span>         <span>G7</span>
Tonight you're mine completely,
<span>C</span>                     <span>G</span>
You give your love so sweetly,
  <span>E</span>         <span>E7</span>       <span>Am</span>
Tonight the light of love is in your eyes,
<span>F</span>            <span>G7</span>        <span>C</span>
But will you love me tomorrow?

[Verse 2]
<span>C</span>                 <span>F</span>          <span>G7</span>
Is this a lasting treasure,
<span>C</span>                  <span>G</span>
Or just a moment's pleasure,
    <span>E</span>   <span>E7</span>         <span>Am</span>
Can I believe the magic of your sighs,
<span>F</span>              <span>G7</span>        <span>C</span>
Will you still love me tomorrow?

[Bridge]
<span>F</span>                    <span>Em</span>
Tonight with words unspoken,
<span>F</span>             <span>G7</span>           <span>C</span>
You said that I'm the only one,
<span>F</span>                    <span>Em</span>
But will my heart be broken,
         <span>Am</span>
When the night (When the night)
          <span>D7</span>      <span>F</span>      <span>G7</span> (hold strings pause) Base run: <span>G</span>  <span>A</span>  <span>C</span>  <span>C</span>  <span>D</span>
Meets the morning sun.

[Verse 3]
<span>C</span>                     <span>F</span>          <span>G7</span>
I'd like to know that your love,
<span>C</span>                <span>G</span>        (hold strings pause) Base run: <span>G</span>  <span>F#</span> <span>F</span>
Is love I can be sure of,                                      So
<span>E</span>       <span>E7</span>       <span>Am</span>
Tell me now and I won't ask again,
<span>F</span>              <span>G7</span>        <span>C</span>
Will you still love me tomorrow?
<span>F</span>              <span>G7</span>        <span>C</span>
Will you still love me tomorrow?</pre>
