<pre>[Verse 1]

       <span>Em</span>                <span>D6/9</span>
On the first part of the journey
       <span>Em</span>                <span>D6/9</span>
I was lookin at all the life
            <span>Em</span>                 <span>D6/9</span>
There were plants and birds and rocks and things
            <span>Em</span>                <span>D6/9</span>
There were sand and hills and rings

       <span>Em</span>                   <span>D6/9</span>
The first thing I met was a fly with a buzz
         <span>Em</span>           <span>D6/9</span>
and the sky with no clouds
     <span>Em</span>                   <span>D6/9</span>
the heat was hot and the ground was dry
         <span>Em</span>              <span>D6/9</span>
but the air was full of sound


[Chorus]

      <span>Em9</span>                         <span>Dmaj9</span>
I've been through the desert on a horse with no name
        <span>Em9</span>                   <span>Dmaj9</span>
it felt good to be out of the rain
       <span>Em9</span>           <span>Dmaj9</span>
in the desert you can remember your name
              <span>Em9</span>                <span>Dmaj9</span>
'cause there ain't no one for to give you no pain
   <span>Em9</span>    <span>Dmaj9</span>
La la   la la lala la lala
<span>Em9</span>    <span>Dmaj9</span>
la la la


[Verse 2]

       <span>Em</span>                <span>D6/9</span>
After two days in the desert sun
    <span>Em</span>                <span>D6/9</span>
my skin began to turn red
       <span>Em</span>              <span>D6/9</span>
After three days in the desert fun
       <span>Em</span>                <span>D6/9</span>
I was looking at a river bed
        <span>Em</span>                <span>D6/9</span>
And the story it told of a river that flowed
       <span>Em</span>                 <span>D6/9</span>
made me sad to think it was dead


[Chorus]

      <span>Em9</span>                         <span>Dmaj9</span>
I've been through the desert on a horse with no name
        <span>Em9</span>                   <span>Dmaj9</span>
it felt good to be out of the rain
       <span>Em9</span>           <span>Dmaj9</span>
in the desert you can remember your name
              <span>Em9</span>                <span>Dmaj9</span>
'cause there ain't no one for to give you no pain
   <span>Em9</span>    <span>Dmaj9</span>
la la   la la lala la lala
<span>Em9</span>    <span>Dmaj9</span>
la la la


[Verse 3]

       <span>Em</span>                <span>D6/9</span>
After nine days I let the horse run free
            <span>Em</span>                <span>D6/9</span>
'cause the desert had turned to sea
            <span>Em</span>                  <span>D6/9</span>
there were plants and birds and rocks and things
             <span>Em</span>                <span>D6/9</span>
there were sand and hills and rings
      <span>Em</span>                        <span>D6/9</span>
The ocean is a desert with it's life underground
          <span>Em</span>              <span>D6/9</span>
and the perfect disguise above
            <span>Em</span>           <span>D6/9</span>
Under the cities lies a heart made of ground
         <span>Em</span>                 <span>D6/9</span>
but the humans will give no love


[Chorus]

      <span>Em9</span>                         <span>Dmaj9</span>
I've been through the desert on a horse with no name
        <span>Em9</span>                   <span>Dmaj9</span>
it felt good to be out of the rain
       <span>Em9</span>           <span>Dmaj9</span>
in the desert you can remember your name
              <span>Em9</span>                <span>Dmaj9</span>
'cause there ain't no one for to give you no pain
   <span>Em9</span>    <span>Dmaj9</span>
la la   la la lala la lala
<span>Em9</span>    <span>Dmaj9</span>
la la la </pre>
